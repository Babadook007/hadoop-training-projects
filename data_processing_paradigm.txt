Big data Processing Paradigm vs SQL
=================================
Projection			- SELECT 													Map class
Transformation		- applying a scalar function on a item	upper(), an expr	Map
Filtering			- applying a predicate  WHERE								Map
Merging/Joining		- Joining	JOIN on											Map/Reduce
Aggregation			- many-to-one functions e.g sum, max, min, avg, stddev		Reducer
Ordering/Sorting	- ORDER BY													Shuffling (Partitioner)/Reducer/Comparators (SortComparators, GroupComparators)
Job Chaining		- Inline view												Multiple MapReduce jobs


Job chaing in sql
============
select a, b c from (select ds.f.as as a, 1 as b, 29 as c from (select * from table where true))	stage 1
select a, b c from (select ds.f.as as a, 1 as b, 29 as c from v)								stage 2
select a, b c from v2																			stage 3
