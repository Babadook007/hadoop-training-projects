-- a file from one format to the other
insert into daily_prices_avro select * from daily_prices_1;   -- append
insert overwrite table daily_prices_avro select * from daily_prices_1;  -- deletes and writes


-- load
load data inpath '/user/datadev/hadoop-training/rawdata/stock-prices' into table daily_prices;

load data inpath '/user/datadev/hadoop-training/rawdata/stock-prices' overwrite table daily_prices;


-- ctas (create table as select statement)

-- insert into directory

!sh hdfs dfs -rm -R /user/datadev/hadoop-training/output/pig/total_stock_volume
insert overwrite directory '/user/datadev/hadoop-training/output/pig/total_stock_volume'
row format delimited 
fields terminated by '\001'
